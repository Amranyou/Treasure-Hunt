# Treasure-Hunt

# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The Treasure Hunt game is a path finding problem where the NPC has to find the treasure before the human. The game takes place inside an 8 X 8 matrix that has a total of 64-states with four possible actions. The NPC, or the intelligent agent in this case, starts exploring from the top of the maze until it finds the treasure. Through the implementation of neural networks, reinforcement learning, and Q-algorithms, I was able to train the agent to find the treasure.

# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists solve real life problems using software. Computer science has influenced and facilitated the development of many studies. For example, the tools that NASA uses are developed by computer scientists, and the tools medical professionals use to save lives are also developed by computer scientists. The sciences are all interconnected and leverage the achievements of one field to influence the other. The work computer scientists do is important because it saves lives, takes people to outer space, and creates robotics to simplify life. 

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

A computer scientist’s job is to solve problems using software. Some programs take decades or more to solve. The problem-solving process computer scientists take is iterative and builds upon the work of earlier generations who had their fair chance of contributions to the field. Often times, computer scientists break a large problem into digestible pieces and solve each piece individually.

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

As computer science continues to influence the world, ethical and social concerns rise to address the implications of new technology. Computer scientists owe it to society to develop software that is not harmful to living things and the environment. Additionally, computer scientists have an obligation to embrace transparency so that the software’s goals, limitations, and data collection, processing, and storing are clearly communicated in the software and understood by the targeted audience.
